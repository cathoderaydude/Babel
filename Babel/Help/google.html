<div class="title">Babel Manual - V1.0 - Google Cloud Account Setup</div>
<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This has been restated over and over in this documentation and in the 
program, but it cannot be stressed enough: This is a paid product, and you need 
to be careful about any service that you put your credit card into.</p>
<p>Babel is only an interface to Google Cloud Services. We have no control over 
how Google Cloud functions, it could break in ways we can't predict, and above 
all else we cannot do anything about what they charge.</p>
<p>This is a <em>paid service</em> which you may, possibly, be able to use 
without paying anything, if you are careful about how you use it. However, that 
is a <em>guess</em> based on Google's documentation, and Babel's developers are 
not responsible if this speculation doesn't work. It is your responsibility to 
monitor your own account usage and see how you're being billed.</p>
<p>We are doing nothing but restating Google's own documentation and the text of 
their own software. In return for a more-or-less free translation program, you 
are taking on the burden of learning on your own about how the underlying 
service works and finding out if it's safe to use for your purposes.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Babel requires a Google Cloud Services account and an API key to use. You 
will need to register an account, activate two services, and generate a keyfile 
in order to use Babel. This document will give you the rough steps for how to do 
this.</p>
<p>If you miss a step or if something changes, Google will generally return an 
error that Babel will show you which will explain how to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Let's begin!</p>
<h1>Register a Google Cloud account</h1>
<p>Go to cloud.google.com, click the "get started" link, and log in with your 
Google account.</p>
<p>As part of this process, you will have to put in a valid credit card. Google 
may initially tell you that you won't be billed, but that's only for the first 
year, after which you'll need to enable billing on your account.</p>
<p>At this point you should be logged in to the Google Cloud dashboard.</p>
<h1>Create a Project</h1>
<p><img alt="Google Cloud project name" src="Images/img17.jpg" /></p>
<p>When you first log in, Cloud creates a project called "My First Project." You 
can use this if you want, it'll work fine.</p>
<p>Click on the arrow next to the name to see the project list:</p>
<p><img alt="Project list" src="Images/img18.jpg" /></p>
<p>You could create a new project if you want from here, or just use the default 
one.</p>
<p>You'll notice the ID field is highlighted here. That's the "Project Name" 
that you'll need later. If you make a new project, make sure you find this ID 
and make a note of it. You can close this window now.</p>
<h1>Enable APIs</h1>
<p>You need to enable two APIs, <em>Cloud Vision</em> and <em>Cloud Translation</em>. 
The easiest way to do this is to type their names in the search field at the 
top:</p>
<p><img alt="Search field" src="Images/img1B.jpg" /></p>
<p>Click on the API result and you should see this page:</p>
<p><img alt="API enable page" class="auto-style1" src="Images/img1C.jpg" /></p>
<p>Click the Enable button. Repeat for the second API.</p>
<h1>Create a Service Account</h1>
<p>Now you need to create a <em>Service Account</em>, which will be used to 
authenticate Babel. To do this, go to the menu in the upper 
left, select <em>IAM &amp; Admin</em>, and then <em>Service Accounts</em>:</p>
<p><a href="Images/img1E.jpg">
<img alt="Service account menu" height="320" src="Images/img1E_small.jpg" width="242" /><!-- MSComment="autothumbnail" xthumbnail-orig-image="file:///C:/Users/dthom/Documents/My Web Sites/BabelHelp/Images/img1E.jpg" --></a></p>
<p>From here, click <strong>Add Service Account</strong><em>:</em></p>
<p><a href="Images/img1F.jpg">
<img alt="Adding a service account" height="154" src="Images/img1F_small.jpg" width="320" /><!-- MSComment="autothumbnail" xthumbnail-orig-image="file:///C:/Users/dthom/Documents/My Web Sites/BabelHelp/Images/img1F.jpg" --></a></p>
<p>Put in whatever you like for the name and click <strong>Create</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="Images/img24.jpg">
<img alt="Selecting roles" height="257" src="Images/img24_small.jpg" width="320" /><!-- MSComment="autothumbnail" xthumbnail-orig-image="file:///C:/Users/dthom/Documents/My Web Sites/BabelHelp/Images/img24.jpg" --></a></p>
<p>Now you need to specify the Roles to be assigned. Select <em>Cloud 
Translation API User</em> as shown above, then click<strong> Add Another Role
</strong>and select <em>Cloud Vision API User.</em></p>
<p>Click <strong>Done</strong> on the next page. You should then see your new 
account:</p>
<p><img alt="New service account" src="Images/img28.jpg" /></p>
<p>Click on the name of the account, then <strong>Add New Key</strong>, and then
<strong>Create New Key</strong>:</p>
<p><img alt="Create new key" src="Images/img29.jpg" /></p>
<p>Pick <strong>JSON</strong> in the popup. This will download a file. This is 
your JSON keyfile. Put it in your Babel folder.</p>
<p class="auto-style2" style="border-color: red !important;"><strong>This 
absolutely cannot be stressed enough: </strong>This file will give a hacker 
access to use your account to make translation and OCR requests. Google will not 
put a cap on how many they can make. Guard this file with your life, as if it 
were the password to your bank account. Delete it if you aren't going to use the 
program for a while, and make a new one when you need it again.</p>
<h1>Configure Babel with keyfile</h1>
<p><img alt="Babel Settings dialog" src="Images/img2C.gif" /></p>
<p>Open Babel, go to the Settings, and configure as above. Use the Browse button 
to select the keyfile you saved, and put the Project Name in the appropriate 
field.</p>
<p>Click OK, and you're ready to use Babel!</p>
