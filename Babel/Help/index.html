<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Babel is a free translation utility intended primarily for light home use 
(non-professional applications) to translate things like old videogames and 
documentation. Babel will work with anything you give it, but is really designed 
around these applications.</p>
<p>It was originally developed to translate software from 1980s Japanese 
computers - just enough to navigate a Japanese operating system or identify the 
menu options in an RPG, for instance. For these purposes, it often works well. 
The further you get from this, such as trying to translate manga or magazines, 
the less useful you will find it. It is not advisable, for instance, to attempt 
a fan translation of a manga or videogame using this application; leave those 
tasks to people who speak the language!</p>
<p>In reality, Babel is "simply" an interface to Google's Cloud Vision and Cloud 
Translate services. However, those services are extremely limited in their 
functionality, and Babel provides much that you cannot get from Google's own 
applications - in particular, there is no native Windows client, and the web 
client for Translate is very basic. Babel lets you do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Grab a screenshot ("snap" for short) of anything on your desktop</li>
	<li>Rapidly capture new snaps from e.g. an emulator without tediously 
	re-selecting the region over and over</li>
	<li>Paste snaps from the clipboard</li>
	<li>Save snaps with translated (or original) text overlaid</li>
	<li>Specify which parts of the image should be treated as one discrete piece 
	of text (or "phrase" for short) to aid in correct translation<ul>
		<li>Apply a simple algorithm to automate this step with the click of a 
		button</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Adjust phrase locations to tune the translation</li>
	<li>Copy translated (or raw) text, one phrase at a time or in bulk</li>
	<li>Type or paste in text to be translated (so you don't have to keep 
	visiting the Google website)</li>
</ul>
<p>The program may appear overly complex at first, but all the features are 
essential, and several buttons you'll probably never use. Translation, and 
OCR-based translation in particular, is a very touchy process that requires lots 
of human input, and while Babel attempts to make it as simple as possible, 
there's only so much that can be done automatically.</p>
<p>In practice, you'll learn to use Babel quickly and efficiently in no time. 
Let's get started!</p>
<h1>Critical Disclaimer - <span class="auto-style1">Read This Now!</span></h1>
<p>You must understand and agree to the below in order to use this program.
<strong>Do not skip this section - it concerns your financial safety!</strong></p>
<p><strong>First:</strong> This app has no intrinsic translation capability. It 
depends on Google Cloud services, which you must sign up for and obtain 
credentials for on your own. This process requires a valid credit card. If you 
are for whatever reason unable to do this, or you are blocked from Google Cloud 
for any reason, this app cannot be used.</p>
<p><strong>Second:</strong> In the process of configuring Google Cloud, you will 
need to obtain an <em>API key file</em>. You must secure this file as if it were 
your credit card. While the instructions here will explain how to apply <em>very 
limited</em> security to your account, if someone gets this file, they could run 
up an enormous translation bill and you will have to pay it. If you aren't 
comfortable with this, <em>do not use Babel!</em> </p>
<p><strong>Third:</strong> The developers of Babel are not responsible for any 
expenditure incurred as a result of the use of this program. Google Cloud is a 
paid service, and if you have concerns about limiting how much you can be 
charged, you will need to take that up with Google. If a defect in Babel results 
in unintended transactions, you are solely responsible for them, and your only 
recourse is to not use the application.</p>
<p>The above disclaimers are unfortunate realities of the way this program 
works. Google, at the time of this programs release, has not seen fit to 
implement reasonable security measures in their cloud platform. As the 
developers of this software, we find this outrageous and unbelievable, but have 
no power to affect it. You use this software entirely at your own risk.</p>
